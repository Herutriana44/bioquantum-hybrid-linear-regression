## Current Limitations

This research has several limitations that can be further improved:

1. The quantum computing and organoid intelligence components are still relatively simple in their current implementation.
2. The evaluation is currently limited and does not yet provide strong empirical validation.
3. The dataset used is synthetic and includes only a single feature.
